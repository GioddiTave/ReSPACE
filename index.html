                    Skill you learned in space:<br>
                    Mastery of interstellar diplomacy 
                    and logic-based problem-solving

                    Best space travel snack:<br>
                    Nutritional efficiency supersedes 
                    personal preference, but if required, 
                    Vulcan plomeek soup provides sustenance 
                    and comfort.

                    If you were stranded on a deserted moon, 
                    what three items would you want with you?<br>
                    1.Tricorder for data analysis and communication.<br>
                    2.Phaser for defense and signaling.<br>
                    3.Emergency survival kit containing rations, shelter, 
                    and medical supplies.

                    Zero gravity dance move:<br>
                    Dancing is a highly illogical activity, but if compelled, 
                    a precise and controlled series of movements resembling 
                    the Vulcan meditation ritual.

                    They're out of this world, though.
                    
                    Skill you learned in space:<br>
                    Botanical wizardry and MacGyver-level improvisation.

                    Best space travel snack:<br>
                    Potato chips, of course. 
                    Grown, sliced, and fried in the vacuum of space.

                    If you were stranded on a deserted moon,

                    1.My trusty botanist's kit, complete with 
                    Martian soil samples and potato seeds.<br>
                    2.Communications equipment to establish 
                    contact with Earth and potential rescue missions.<br>
                    3.An abundance of duct tape. Seriously, 
                    duct tape fixes everything.<br>
